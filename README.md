# What is IntEqual?

As I was pretty much bored, I thought of writing a simple equal function which actually compares two integers and returns true if the integers are equal or false if they are not equal. 

# How does it work?

It basically subtracts both of the integer and if they are equal, they will return 0 now 0 is of course not divisible by 1 thus nodejs returns infinity and that helps in deciding whether the integers are equal or not. Cool right?
